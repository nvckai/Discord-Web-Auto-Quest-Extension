# Discord Web Auto Quest Extension (Loader Version)

<img align="right" src="./assets/icon.png" width=200 alt="Discord Auto Quest Extension logo">

**This is a specialized Loader Extension.**

It does not contain the core logic locally. Instead, it dynamically fetches and runs the latest script directly from the main repository branch: **[https://github.com/nvckai/Discord-Web-Auto-Quest-Extension/tree/main](https://github.com/nvckai/Discord-Web-Auto-Quest-Extension/tree/main)**

This ensures you always use the latest version without needing to update the extension manually repeatedly.
